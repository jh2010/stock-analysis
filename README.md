## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help Steve to expand his research about the entire stock market over the last few years. He wants to analyze a large number of stocks but the existing Excel (VBA Macro enabled) spreadsheet is not efficient enough to handle this in a reasonable amount of time.  The existing Excel VBA Macro will need to be refactored in order to increase its performance so it can analyze the market at a larger scale.
