# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help Steve to expand his research about the entire stock market over the last few years. He wants to analyze a large number of stocks but the existing Excel (VBA Macro enabled) spreadsheet is not efficient enough to handle this in a reasonable amount of time.  The existing Excel VBA Macro will need to be refactored in order to increase its performance so it can analyze the market at a larger scale.

### Results
As we can see from the analysis (See images below), the majority of the stocks did not perform well in 2018 as oposed to 2017.  The only two companies that showed increased returns in 2018 were **ENPH** and **RUN**.  Also, the company **TERP** did not have positive returns for both years.

### Summary
The advantages of refactoring code are increased efficiency and performance.  The disadvantages of refactoring code are increased development time.

After refactoring the original VBA code, the run time was reduced.
